Hello, my name is **Bruno Russi**. I am a **DevOps Engineer** with 10 years of experience in the tech industry. During my career, I have also worked as a **Software Engineer**, using technologies like JavaScript, Python, and Golang. 

Currently, my focus is on **cloud computing and infrastructure as code**. I have extensive experience with tools like Terraform, Terragrunt, AWS CDK, and Kubernetes to create **scalable and resilient cloud environments**.

I believe that developing software is **not** just about implementing features or fixing bugs, **but about understanding the client's real needs and solving problems at the root**, making people's lives better.

In my free time, I enjoy cycling and creating content for my YouTube channel, where I share my knowledge and experiences.
